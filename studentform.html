    <p> These questions aim to help you and your tutor get to know each other. Don’t worry if you’re not sure yet about everything. If you have time before discussing with your tutor, you might note down ideas and then add to them as you speak together. You can always return to these questions later. The next page has a few pointers to get ready for your first tutoring session.  </p>

      <H1> Discussion of study and learning styles </H1>

      <p> What kinds of support might you like from your tutor? Sticking to a schedule? Explanation of words and ideas? What might tutoring make possible or easier (than if studying alone)?  </p>

<input/>

      <p> Do you have a sense of your learning style or how you study best? The <a href="https://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/"> VARK model</a> may help. (1) kinesthetic (physical movement) / (2) auditory (listening) / (3) reading + writing / (4) visual (seeing)? </p>

<input/>

      <p> Discuss your preferred working style and pace. How might a 90-minute session be organized? 3 sections of 30 minutes? 4 sections of around 20 minutes? Will you take breaks? </p>

        <H1> Suggestions (not a complete guide!) for preparing and discussing readings </H1>

        <p> Read (and, if possible, reread) everything to be covered. When working alone, be patient with yourself. Think about what’s hard for you to do on your own and keep talking with your tutor about what’s working for you.  </p>

            <td> As you work, imagine a real test-taking situation. It’s best to move on to the next question if you’ve already spent lots of time on one that seems unclear.</td>
            <td> Your tutor will check on understanding but you don’t have to wait to ask follow-up questions that go deeper than the multiple-choice answer. </td>

          <tr>
            <td> <b> Chapters from a textbook </b> </td>
            <td> Look up new words and concepts. If the dictionary entry doesn’t explain enough, make a note to ask about it. </td>
            <td> If you’re already sure about understanding a concept, let your tutor know so that you can move on to something harder.</td>

            <td> <b> Writing practice </b> </td>
            <td> For journal entries, write what you know how to write (use words that you’re confident about) but also push yourself (try out some new words and longer sentences).</td>
            <td> Discussing a journal entry is a great way to develop your written voice – you’ll hear from your tutor how your ideas came across and how closely it matches what you meant.</td>

          <tr>
            <td> <b> Fun reading </b> </td>
            <td> Try out some of the same strategies that you use for the other materials. Ideally, they will help not just on a test but in all types of reading.</td>
            <td> If there’s an important section or a question that you wanted to bring up, don’t let time end without covering it.</td>
          </tr>
