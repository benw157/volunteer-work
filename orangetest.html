    <p>These questions are intended to help you and your student get to know each other. Don’t worry if you’re not sure yet how you might work together. You can note down ideas as you discuss and return to the conversation later. The second page has a few pointers for lesson planning. </p>

      <H1> Goals and interests </H2>

        <p> Student’s practical long-term goals (such as: Pass a test or Get a high school equivalency) </p>

        <input/>

          <p> Student’s personal goals and interests (such as: Enjoy reading more or Explore a new subject) </p>

          <input/>


      <H1> Discussion of study and learning styles </H1>

      <p> What kinds of support would your student like from you? Sticking to a schedule? Explanation of words and ideas? What might tutoring make possible or make easier (than if studying alone)? </p>

<input/>

      <p> Student self-assessment of learning style according to the 4-part <a href="https://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/"> VARK model: </a> (1) kinesthetic (physical movement) / (2) auditory (listening) / (3) reading + writing / (4) visual (seeing)? </p>

<input/>

      <p> Discuss your student’s preferred working style and pace. How might a 90-minute session be organized? 3 sections of 30 minutes? 4 sections of around 20 minutes? Will you take breaks? </p>

        <H1> Some suggestions (not a comprehensive guide!) for lesson planning</H1>

        <p> Your plan might start simply with a list of activities and a time estimate for each. Mix it up – for example, do something challenging and follow it with something that comes more naturally. No matter what the material, read everything to be covered at least once. </p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th colspan="2">Suggestions for planning</th>
            <th>Suggestions for the meeting</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> <b> Practice test questions </b> </td>
            <td>If a practice test has a confusingly worded question, resolve in advance what it’s asking and just why it’s ambiguous. When you meet, share your own comprehension strategies. </td>
            <td>After something new is covered, double back later to check for comprehension. Instead of yes–no questions, ask “Can you tell me how you understand X?”</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> <b> Chapters from a textbook </b> </td>
            <td>Reword otherwise simplify complex ideas. Don’t feel pressure to make everything visual if your student self-identifies as visual. Think of learning style as a means of deciding sometimes on an approach (whether to draw a sketch or explain out loud).</td>
            <td>Before covering something that might be new, ask an open-ended question on prior knowledge. It may be that something you had expected to explain is already clear.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> <b> Writing practice </b> </td>
            <td>Discuss with your student how to handle feedback. By email? On paper? In person? Would your student like feedback on grammar or content only?</td>
            <td>When correcting errors, consider whether issues of grammar or pronunciation (for ELL students) are repeated and whether they truly impede comprehensibility (don’t lose too much time on nuances).</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> <b> Fun reading </b> </td>
            <td>Verify comprehension by asking your student to retell the story in a new way. If the events occur out of order, ask your student to note them down chronologically.</td>
            <td>Watch the clock but don’t worry if you don’t get to everything in the plan! After the first session, you’ll have a better idea of how you and your partner work together. </td>
          </tr>
