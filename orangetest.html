    <p>These questions are intended to help you and your student get to know each other. Don’t worry if you’re not sure yet how you might work together. You can note down ideas as you discuss and return to the conversation later. The second page has a few pointers for lesson planning. </p>

    <H1> Contact information </H1>
      <p> Student's name </p>

      <H1> Meeting place and time(s) </H1>
        <p> Place </p>

      <H1> Discussion of study and learning styles </H1>

      <p> What kinds of support would your student like from you? Sticking to a schedule? Explanation of words and ideas? What might tutoring make possible or make easier (than if studying alone)? </p>

        <H1> Some suggestions (not a comprehensive guide!) for lesson planning</H1>
